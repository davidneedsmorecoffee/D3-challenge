# Graphing analysis results using D3 demo

In this demo the 2014 ACS (American Community Survey) 1-year estimates from census.gov [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) was used for the analysis.

The data set analyzed include rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. The MOE variable in the ata set is represents the "margin of error."

See the `app.js` file for additional info on how the D3 figures were constructed.
